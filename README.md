#### Scripts to replicate "Global Gradients in the Distribution of Animal Polyploids"

- `filter_coordinates.r` Perform additional filtering steps on GBIF download file [example](https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.2jxpma)

- `extract_geodata.r` Create environmental data tables from filtered coordinates and geographic raster files LINK

- `primary_analyses.r` Run models and generate summary statistics for all primary analysis, using environmental data tables and phylogenies LINK

Note that scripts refer to "Amphibia" but can also be used for the other clades by simply changing file names, identical procedures were used for all three groups
